# About Me

Welcome to Grassy's Notebook, your trusted source for all things aviation, finance, and career improvement.

## About Grassy

Grassy, has dedicated his career to aviation and leadership. Graduating Summa Cum Laude from the Missouri University of Science and Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Nuclear Engineering and a minor in Mathematics, I was commissioned through in the Marine Corps in June 2008.

After completing The Basic School Course in 2009, I commenced flight training at NAS Pensacola, FL, and Corpus Christi, TX, earning my designation as a Naval Aviator in June 2011. My journey then took me to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Training Squadron 204 for initial training in the MV-22B. This path led to multiple deployments, including humanitarian relief efforts in the Philippines and Nepal, and combat missions in Iraq.

In 2019, I was selected for Test Pilot School and subsequently served as the V-22 Integrated Test Team Government Flight Test Director, gaining extensive experience in Developmental Flight Test and Evaluation. My role evolved into an Aviation Acquisitions Officer, leading the MV-22 Inventory Management and Common Configuration initiatives at the V-22 Joint Program Office. Currently, I serve as the Chief Test Pilot at UX-24, and hold a qualification in the MQ-9. Over my carrier I have logged flight hours in 23 different aircraft.

I hold a Masterâ€™s Degree in Systems Engineering from the Naval Post Graduate School and am a DAWIA qualified practitioner in Test and Evaluation.
