# Hello, world!

I wanted to take some time to write my first blog post using markdown (MDX) in Remix. Writing content in MDX is extremely easy and allows integration across various platforms. I drew insperation from the [Remix blog](https://remix.run/blog),[Pedro Cattori](https://github.com/pcattori/remix-blog-mdx), [Brad Garropy](https://github.com/bradgarropy/bradgarropy.com/), and [Raj Talks Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@raj_talks_tech) to create my own blog. Piecing together the various parts of the code to create this blog was a fun and rewarding experience. There are a few things that make this deployment unique. First, I am using [Remix](https://remix.run) as the framework to build this blog. Remix is a full stack framework that allows developers to build web applications using React. Second, I am using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy this blog. Vercel is a cloud platform that allows developers to easily deploy web applications. I am using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) to write my blog posts. MDX is a markdown syntax that allows developers to write JSX in markdown. This allows for creating dynamic content that can be rendered on the web. 

I started this blog to share my ideas, experiences, and projects so others can learn from them. I hope that you find this blog helpful and informative. If you have any questions or comments, please contact me on [X](https://x.com/JasonNoll4). I look forward to hearing from you.
